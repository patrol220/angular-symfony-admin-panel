# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed

parameters:

services:
  # default configuration for services in *this* file
  _defaults:
    autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
    autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.

  # makes classes in src/ available to be used as services
  # this creates a service per class whose id is the fully-qualified class name
  App\:
    resource: '../src/*'
    exclude: '../src/{DependencyInjection,Entity,Migrations,Tests,Kernel.php,Dto,Exception}'

  # controllers are imported separately to make sure services can be injected
  # as action arguments even if you don't extend any base controller class
  App\Controller\:
    resource: '../src/Controller'
    tags: ['controller.service_arguments']

  # add more service definitions when explicit configuration is needed
  # please note that last definitions always *replace* previous ones
